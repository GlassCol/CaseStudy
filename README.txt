# Food_Delivery_App

The food delivery app is meant as practice for full stack web development. In this specific case the goal is to produce
an application where you can see/add to/edit a list of restaurants and their respective menus

# Design
This is a react app using a java spring boot api to connect to a database of the user's choice

# Installation

Simply installing and running the front and back end will function but you will want to have your own database set up
on port 8080 name food_delivery as well as setting the configuration file in the API to your local settings i.e. your
username and password for your database

# Status

This project is still being developed and should be done shortly
